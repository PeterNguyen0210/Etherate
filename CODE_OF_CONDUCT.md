# Contributor Code of Conduct

## The Pledge

I (James Bensley) write Etherate with specific requirements in mind (those of
my day job). Feature ideas, pull requests, diffs, patches etc are all welcome.
However, a pull request or patch that is both significant in terms of size or
impact and not reasonably related to my design goals for Etherate, in my
opinion, might not get merged or accepted. Alternatively I might do but it
might take some time for me to review. This is because I don't have much time
to work on Etherate these days. All feedback, comments, ideas etc are welcomed.

## Scope

With all of the above in mind, try and be courteous and open minded and we'll
see what happens. If you're a dick, I probably won't accept your pull requests
or try to help you with issues.

## Contact

Email (James) jwbensley@gmail.com if you have concertns or queries etc about
anything related to Etherate. I'll always try to be sympathetic to your
situation and questions.
